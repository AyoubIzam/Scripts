## About This Repo:

This repo contains JS scripts that help in customizing some inexisting features in the system:

- If u want an easy way to look up a function in this repo, so we sorted out a way of lookup using VERBS.
- Every file contains one only function, and Every file starts with a verb.
- u probably, coming here, have a question that needs an answer or are desperate for a helping hint => use the most prominant verb in ur question to look up what u want. 
- Use these verbs as keywords to find want u looking for:

Append
Add
Remove
Hide 
Swap
Round
Convert

** We will try to limit these verbs to the minimal as possible so it would be easy to find what u r seeking.
